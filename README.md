# 🧾 Agentic Invoice Parser –

This repository contains the capstone project for the **Post Graduate Program in AI & Machine Learning** – an **Agentic Workflow-based Invoice Parser** designed to extract structured data from complex Indian invoice PDFs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In real-world enterprise settings, invoices often arrive as PDF files containing **multiple invoices**, with each invoice potentially spanning **multiple pages** and including **tables, images, and varied layouts**. This project leverages an **agentic architecture** to intelligently parse, segment, and extract relevant information from such documents into a structured schema.

Built using **Pydantic-AI** and **Pydantic-Graph**, the workflow uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to reason through document structure and extract key fields in a reliable, modular fashion.
